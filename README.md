### The Task

Our team was tasked with making sense of a New Zealand dataset, and adding value to it by building a functional MVP, in one weekend (16 hours).

### The Problem

The problem we identified centered around New Zealand's frequently changing weather conditions at sea. If you're a boatie planning to head you, Good to Go is your last minute go/no-go advisor promoting the safety of on-water activities through the consolidation of multiple data sources.

### The MVP

Our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) has been deployed to Heroku and can be accessed [here](https://good-2-go.herokuapp.com). It runs best in the Google Chrome browser. Simply follow the instructions on the page to see if your planned location is deemed 'safe'.

#### Location Deemed 'Safe'
Based on various current weather parameters, a 'Good to Go' recommendation is made. Additionally, the distances to the nearest New Zealand Coastguard stations are shown.

#### Location Deemed 'Unsafe'
When 'Not Good to Go' weather/water conditions are identified, an appropriate recommendation is made.
